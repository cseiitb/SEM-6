(TAs in charge: Siddharth A. and Krishna Murthy Bukkapatnam)

<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/sim/halffieldoffense/">Half
Field Offense</a> (HFO) is a multi-agent task that is a part
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup_2D_Soccer_Simulation_League">RoboCup
soccer</a>. As apparent from the video below, it is a simplified
version of soccer played on one half of the soccer field between an
offense team and a defense team. Each coloured circular disk is a
soccer player, controlled by a separate client program. The clients
connect and communicate with a server, periodically getting snapshots
of their state and specifying actions. The server implements the
physical simulation, and applies the rules of soccer. The HFO
simulator allows us to simulate and evaluate several
offensive/defensive strategies involving teams of different sizes.</p>

</p>

<p>In this assignment, we shall focus solely on the <b>behaviour of an
offense player when it is in possession of the ball</b>. When not in
possession of the ball, offense players play a fixed strategy. The
defense players, too, follow a fixed, programmed, strategy. When the
offense team does not have possession of the ball, at least one player
goes straight to the ball in order to get possession. What must it do
once it has possession?</p>

<p>The player represents its state through features such as distances
and angles between itself and other players, as well as with static
objects such as the goal. The actions available to the player are
DRIBBLE, SHOOT, and PASS(k), wherein k is the index of an offense
teammate (if there are any). Your task is precisely to code the
mapping between state and action: such a mapping is called
a <i>policy</i>.</p>

<p>Detailed descriptions of the state and action spaces are mentioned
in the sections below. A sequence of steps is provided to get you up
and running. You will submit agents for playing 1 versus 1 (1v1) and 2
versus 2 (2v2) HFO.</p>

<h3>Code</h3> 

<a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs344+386-s2017/resources/la-1/HFO-master.tar.gz">HFO-master.tar.gz</a>

<h3>Installation and Execution</h3> 

First, be sure to be connected to the Internet (log in
through <a href="https://internet.iitb.ac.in/">https://internet.iitb.ac.in/</a><a>).

<ol>

<li> Download the tar file and extract it.</li>

<li> Run the following commands inside the <code-normal>HFO-master</code-normal> directory for installation.</li>

<ol>
<li> <code-normal>mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build</code-normal></li>
<li> <code-normal>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..</code-normal></li>
<li> <code-normal>make -j4</code-normal></li>
<li> <code-normal>make install</code-normal></li>
</ol>

<li> Test the installation by running 1v1 and 2v2 simulations; run the
following commands inside the <code-normal>HFO-master</code-normal> directory.
<ol>
<li> <code-normal>./bin/HFO --offense-npcs=1 --defense-npcs=1 --no-sync</code-normal></li>
<li> <code-normal>./bin/HFO --offense-npcs=2 --defense-npcs=2 --no-sync</code-normal></li>
</ol>
You must see 1v1 and 2v2 games being simulated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some of the relevant command line options for running HFO.</p>
<ul>
<li> <code-normal>--no-sync</code-normal>: Run the simulations in
real-time, and not in "synchronised" mode. This option is useful for
visualising behaviours. Running with sync-mode on is significantly
faster, and can be useful for testing the performance of your
agent.</li>
<li> <code-normal>--trials=[num_trials]</code-normal>: Specify the number of episodes by adding this flag.</li>
<li> <code-normal>--fullstate</code-normal>: This option removes noise
in the agent's state features, making decision making easier for the
agent. Your agent will indeed be tested with full state (without state
noise).</li>
<li> <code-normal>--no-logging</code-normal>: No logs will be generated.</li>
<li> <code-normal>--offense-agents=[num_agents]</code-normal>: The
server will wait for <code-normal>num_agents</code-normal> to connect to it before starting the
game.</li>
<li> <code-normal>--defense-npcs=[num_agents]</code-normal>: The
server will spawn <code-normal>num_agents</code-normal> defense
npcs.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can kill simulations by pressing CTRL+c in the terminal running
the server.</p>


<h3>States and Actions</h3> 

<p>The agent's state is represented using a feature vector, which
consists of 10 + 6T + 3O floating point numbers, where T is the number
teammates (one less than the number of offense players), and O is the
number of opponents. The features are listed below in sequence.</p>

 <table style="width:100%">

  <tbody><tr>
    <td><b>Index</b></td>
    <td><b>Feature</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>x position</td>
    <td>Agent's global x coordinate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>y position</td>
    <td>Agent's global y coordinate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Orientation</td>
    <td>The global direction the agent is facing</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Ball x position</td>
    <td>Ball's global x coordinate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Ball y position</td>
    <td>Ball's global y coordinate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Able to Kick</td>
    <td>Boolean indicating if the agent can kick the ball</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Goal centre proximity</td>
    <td>Distance between agent and goal centre</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Goal centre angle</td>
    <td>Angle between x axis and line connecting agent to goal centre</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Goal opening angle</td>
    <td>The magnitude of the largest open angle (between opponents) of
the agent to the goal</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Proximity to opponents</td>
    <td>Proximity to the closest opponent</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>10–(10+T-1)</td>
    <td>Teammate goal opening angle</td>
    <td>For each teammate, its goal opening angle</td> 
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>(10+T)–(10+2T-1)</td>
    <td>Teammate proximity to opponent</td>
    <td>For each teammate, its proximity to its closest opponent</td> 
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>(10+2T)–(10+3T-1)</td>
    <td>Teammate pass opening angle</td>
    <td>For each teammate, the magnitude of the open angle available
    to pass the ball to the teammate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>(10+3T)–(10+6T-1)</td>
    <td>Teammate global x position, teammate global y position, teammate uniform number</td>
    <td>Three consecutive features for each teammate: global x position, global y position, and uniform number</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>(10+6T)–(10+6T+3O-1)</td>
    <td>Opponent global x position, opponent global y position, opponent uniform number</td>
    <td>Three consecutive features for each opponent: global x position, global y position, and uniform number</td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table> 

<p>All non-boolean features except the uniform numbers are normalized
to the range [-1, 1]. It is possible that occasionally a feature
comes marked as "invalid". If so it is given a value of -2.</p>

<p>The following are the actions available to the agent. These are all
"high-level" actions, which are implemented by the agent using
lower-level skills (which we need not bother with for this
assignment).</p>
 
<ol>
<li>SHOOT: This action executes the agent's best possible shot to the goal.</li>
<li>PASS(k): Passes the ball to the teammate with uniform number k.</li>
<li>DRIBBLE: Advances the ball towards the goal using a combination of short kicks and moves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Observe that for 1v1 HFO, the number of state features is 13 and
the number of actions is 2 (PASS is not valid). For 2v2 HFO, the
number of state features is 19 and the number of actions is 3. The
policies you program need not use all the features available; take
some time to think which ones could matter the most.</p>

<h3>Task 0 (Ungraded)</h3> 

<p>This task is to familiarise you with the simulation, the state
variables, and the task facing the offense player with the
ball. Specifically, look at the <code-normal>getAction()</code-normal>
function in 1v1agent.cpp. It is given the state features as input; as
output it picks a legal action uniformly at random. Verify by running
autograder-1v1.sh that this strategy yields a scoring percentage of
approximately 5%.</p>

<p>Use the <code-normal>--no-sync</code-normal> flag to observe the
behaviour of the offense player with the ball. Print out a few
relevant state features to observe how they vary as the configuration
of players on the field
changes. Change <code-normal>getAction()</code-normal> such that the
action chosen depends on some state feature(s). Visualise the
resulting policy.</p>


<h3>Task 1 (4 marks)</h3> 

<p>In this task, you have to program a 1v1 offense agent to maximise
its scoring percentage. Revise
the <code-normal>getAction()</code-normal> function in the file
1v1agent.cpp. Follow these steps to experiment with your code.

</p><ol>
<li>Start the server by running the following command from the <code-normal>main</code-normal> directory.</li>

<br>
         <code-normal>./bin/HFO --offense-agents=1 --defense-npcs=1 --trials=1000
         --fullstate --no-logging --no-sync</code-normal><br><br>

<li>In a new terminal from the <code-normal>example</code-normal>
directory, create the executable by running the following command.</li>
<br>

<code-normal>./make_executable1v1.sh</code-normal><br><br>

<li>Spawn the agent by running the following command.</li><br> 

<code-normal>./1v1agent --numAgents 1</code-normal><br>

</ol>

<p>To check performance of your agent, run <code-normal>./autograder-1v1.sh</code-normal> (in directory
<code-normal>example/</code-normal>). This script will print out the
fraction of episodes that resulted in a goal.</p>


<h3>Task 2 (6 marks)</h3> 

<p>In this task, you have to program a 2v2 offense agent to maximise
the scoring percentage of the offense team. Revise
the <code-normal>getAction()</code-normal> function in the file
2v2agent.cpp. By running the steps below, you will essentially run
both offense players with the same binary (albeit the players will have
different uniform numbers). Hence, both players will execute the code
you fill into <code-normal>getAction()</code-normal> whenever they
have possession of the ball.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the server by running the following command from the <code-normal>main</code-normal> directory.</li>

<br>
         <code-normal>./bin/HFO --offense-agents=2 --defense-npcs=2
--trials=1000 --fullstate --no-logging --no-sync</code-normal><br><br>

<li>In a new terminal from the <code-normal>example</code-normal>
directory, create the executable by running the following command.</li>
<br>

<code-normal>./make_executable2v2.sh</code-normal><br><br>

<li>Spawn the agent by running the following command.</li><br> 

<code-normal>./2v2agent --numAgents 2</code-normal><br>

</ol>

<p>To check performance of your agent, run <code-normal>./autograder-2v2.sh</code-normal> (in directory
<code-normal>example/</code-normal>). This script will print out the fraction of episodes that resulted in a
goal.</p>

<p>You are likely to find the <code-normal>PASS</code-normal> action
useful for increasing the scoring percentage in 2v2 HFO. Although in
general, <code-normal>PASS</code-normal> needs to be passed the
uniform number of a teammate as argument, the code you are given is
set up such that <code-normal>PASS</code-normal> (without any
arguments) in 2v2 HFO will automatically pass the ball to the sole
teammate of the offense agent with the ball.</p>

<h3>Submission</h3> 

Place 1v1agent.cpp and 2v2agent.cpp (the two files that you have
edited) in a directory named your roll number (say 12345678). Tar and
Gzip the directory to produce a single compressed file
(12345678.tar.gz). Submit this file on Moodle, under Lab Assignment 1.

<h3>Evaluation</h3> 

<p>Your agents will be evaluated by calling the corresponding
autograder scripts.</p>

<p>The 1v1 agent will be evaluated for 4 marks. It will be given 4
marks if its goal scoring percentage exceeds 75%, otherwise 3 marks if
it exceeds 60%, otherwise 2 marks if it exceeds 50%, otherwise 0
marks. Extra credit of 2 marks will be awarded if the agent's goal
scoring percentage exceeds 95%.</p>

<p>The 2v2 agent will be evaluated for 6 marks. It will be given 6
marks if its goal scoring percentage exceeds 60%, otherwise 4 marks if
it exceeds 50%, otherwise 2 marks if it exceeds 40%, otherwise 0
marks. Extra credit of 2 marks will be awarded if the agent's goal
scoring percentage exceeds 75%.</p>
